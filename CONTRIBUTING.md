# Contribution Guidelines
Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Libraries that are PHP 5.3+, Composer-installable, PSR compliant, tested and documented are preferred.
* Enter a meaningful pull request description.
* Please make an individual commit for each suggestion in a pull request.
* Put a link to each library in your pull request ticket so they're easier to look at.
* Use the following format for libraries: \[LIBRARY\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION.
* Prefix duplicate library names with their vendor or namespace followed by a space: Foo\Bar would be Foo Bar.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing categorisation, are always welcome.
* Keep descriptions short and simple. 
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
